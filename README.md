# AI_Machine_Test

We have 2 machine tests for you, 

1. Complete this code execution and send us all the steps you have taken with time to complete each step. you also need to identify most accurate data set & combine few data sets from different sources. 

2. You need to identify another sample for the following,
Diabetes
Liver
Cardiac
Kidney
Lungs

We have 3 live projects to start, which you can start from home & based on the progress you can join with our office in Kakkanad. 

1. To read data from BP & gluco meter display.
2. Read 5 lead ECG Image & give all the interpretations ( better than a radiologist)
3.  Read data from a urine strip ( sample urine strip) 

The following are some of the starting points( please do not use this for the final solution), these are just to show you on how a similar project is done. We need the best accuracy. 

1. BP / Gluco meter  sample code - https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03091902.2019.1673844
2. ECG AI ( there are plenty in Kagle & github)
3. Urine strip sample projects - 1. https://www.petnostics.com/, 2. https://www.biosense.in/ucheck.php

As the first step, You need to write a brief description about the project requirement & your understanding about this project. Also include all your questions regardting this project into a technical requirement document and sent to us.
